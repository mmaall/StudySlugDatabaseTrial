Study Slug Refactored

Firebase was not very fun to work with, so let's try and get rid of it! The intent is to remove firebase and replace it with a PostgreSQL database being hosted on AWS EC2. Not using an ORM to better understand how database applications work under the covers. 

Includes some basic test scripts as well. Aiming to implement JUnit.
